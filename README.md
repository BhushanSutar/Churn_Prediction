# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project is an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** based model to predict customer churn. It helps businesses understand whether a customer is likely to leave the service based on various features.  

The model is deployed using **Streamlit**, and preprocessing steps such as **scaling, label encoding, and one-hot encoding** are included for consistency between training and deployment.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Trained on customer churn dataset using **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.  
- Includes preprocessing steps:
  - **Standard Scaler** (`scaler.pkl`)
  - **Label Encoder** (`label_encoder.pkl`)
  - **One-Hot Encoder** (`one_hot_encoder.pkl`)
- Deployment with **Streamlit** for interactive prediction.  
- User-friendly UI to input customer details and get real-time churn predictions.
